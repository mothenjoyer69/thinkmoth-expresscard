# ThinkMoth Expresscard to NVMe
An ExpressCard to NVMe adapter, except this one actually ships! Its also entirely open source from the start, and features additional M.2 2230 support. 

It's still a work in progress, but I'm hoping to get it produced and tested ASAP!

# Features
- Bootable! Either with the native NVMe UEFI driver, or with a bootloader installed on the microSD card
- M.2 2242 *and* M.2 2230 support. On the same board. :3
- Status LEDs for PCIe and microSD activity
- 3D printed case that I should probably start designing soon

# To-do
- Sanity check layout and placement of SD card reader [ ]
- Verify PCIe routing [ ]
- Sanity check ExpressCard design requirements [ ]
- Prototype PCB run :3 [ ]

# Credits
A very big thank you to [Ambra](https://github.com/ambraglow/) for the original board outline, cutout, and EC footprint!

Thanks to everyone at Hackmods for all of the help and advice provided :3
